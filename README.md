# **Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Cab Drivers through Payment Type Analysis**

## **Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to perform hypothesis testing using statistical methods to analyze data and draw conclusions based on sample evidence. The project focuses on applying various statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to validate hypotheses, providing practical insights into decision-making based on data analysis.

## **Project Description:**
This project demonstrates the use of hypothesis testing to make data-driven decisions. It includes various statistical tests like t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA, all performed using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. The goal is to show how to test hypotheses, interpret results, and draw conclusions based on sample data. This project provides a clear, practical approach to applying statistics in real-world scenarios.

## **Project Insights:**
- Applied key statistical tests like t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to validate hypotheses.
- Gained hands-on experience using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy) for statistical analysis.
- Learned how to frame and test hypotheses using real-world data.
- Understood the importance of p-values and how to interpret them to make informed decisions.
- Demonstrated how hypothesis testing helps in decision-making through data analysis.

## **Usage:**
- **Open the Jupyter .ipynb file:** Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to run the analysis and explore the code.
- **Jupyter Notebook file:** Access the Jupyter Notebook file for hands-on analysis and to understand the step-by-step hypothesis testing process. <a href="https://github.com/sayaniketsaini24/Statistics-Project-On-Hypothesis-Testing/blob/main/Statistics_Project_On_Hypothesis_Testing_.ipynb">Clink Here</a>

## **Conclusion:**
This project successfully applied **hypothesis testing** techniques to **analyze data** and make **informed decisions**. By using various **statistical tests**, we demonstrated how to **validate hypotheses** and **interpret results** effectively.
